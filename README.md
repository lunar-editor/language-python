# Python language support in Atom

[![CI](https://github.com/lunar-editor/language-python/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lunar-editor/language-python/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Python files in Atom. Originally [converted](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate) from the [Python TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/python.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
